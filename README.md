## Problem Statement
All OSS repositories may not be maintained properly, because of which, vulnerabilities may get introduced with time. Whereas, some OSS repos could be created by attackers themselves to trick the users. <br>
We need an OSS inspector to solve this problem. This tool will help us to identify the genuineness of the repos and perform a security health check.

## Deliverables/Expectations for Level 2 (Idea + Code Submission)
The solution should :
- Be able to analyse github, pypi, npm and other repos as well
- Should be able to perform scan of repo with link
- Criteria to say a repo/package is vulnerable
- Should provide rating of repo

Other Tips:
- Avoid giving suggestions or just plain solutions. Your idea should be backed by a solid approach and logic.
- You need to submit the code along with the idea proposal deck. 
- Feel free to add links to any demo video as well

## Use-Cases
P0: Checks the authenticity of a website and whether it is safe to use or not
 
P1: Repository owner can check if their package/repository will be considered safe or not for them or others to use

P2: Measures can be provided to secure repository/project via code scanning.

P3: DevOps certification of assets before deployment. If it can be assessed rapidly, automated, and without increasing the risk surface, it should be a part of every Secure DevOps

P4: Deployment architectures that do not easily support network scans â€“ remote devices, cloud, and mobile
